# Tripwire
Program to detect movement in a cubicle using a laser tripwire, showing the live feed from a camera in the computer as a mirror. Intended for private use but it may also inspire someone else.

## Hardware

### Components:
    - FT232H
    - (Photo)Resistor-capacitor (RC) circuit (~5-200KΩ, 10uF, +extra 1KΩ to protect the FT232H and reduce the charge of the capacitor from the pull-up)
    - 5V 5mW Laser head
    - LED + appropriate resistors
